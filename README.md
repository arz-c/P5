# P5
All of my P5 projects

## Flappy Bird
My first ever P5 project, made with help from Code Bullet on YT.

## Snake
I struggled initially with the concept of a tail that follows the head, but eventually got the hang of it.

## Clock
A live EST analog clock - first made the clock a circle, but then turned it into an oval to challenge myself.

## Sudoku
A Sudoku player - live solver and board generator are WIP

## Duet x Flappy Bird Parody
A parody of Duet, a mobile game by Kumobius, and Flappy Bird, a mobile game by Dong Nguyen. The game's concept was thought of by my friend, Josh.

## Wave Game
A web adaptation of the Java-based "Wave Game" that has its own rep on my GitHub.

## Orbit Simulator
A planetary motion simulator with slider for mass of the sun and time delta. Initial velocity of planet can be controlled in the code.
